# MedSched
A scheduling platform for medical offices

# What MedSched Does
Medical offices can customize dates/times their providers are available for meetings, the foods they would prefer, and a way to easily approve or not approve people that sign up for those availabilities.
On the other end, doctors wishing to grow their practices, medical device companies, pharmaceutical companies all could gain access to this scheduling software for a fee to find practices in a desired area and
rather than going through the laborious work of cold calling or emailing all these practices, can simply sign up for practices with only a few clicks of a button.
